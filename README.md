Howdy, plank here.

I'm going to try out github as a repo for my writing. Also maybe some coding stuff if I feel like it.

You can follow my newsletter at https://plank.substack.com or https://getrevue.co/profile/plank

Or you can go directly to my storefont at https://gumroad.com/plank

Happy reading :)
